Simple pages for 404 and 403 errors on webservers. To replace the janky old and ugly default [Nginx](https://github.com/nginx/nginx) pages.

## How to install?
There are multiple online tutorials for this. Here's [one that I found](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/unix-linux-nginx-custom-error-403-page-configuration/) that pretty much covers it.

## Table of Contents
On the root of this repository there are 2 HTML files, the license, and the README you're reading.

The file with the actual pages are the HTML files. Those are the ones you're meant to install on your web server.

## License
This repository and work are licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3.0**. You can read the license and research about it.

## Warranty
I'm not planning on updating this at all. I'm pretty sure this is the final commit for it.


## Credits
Nobody else other than me worked on this project. If you find a bug (or a better way to create this web page than I created it), feel free to make a pull request and I'll be happy to merge it.
